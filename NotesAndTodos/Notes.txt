symfony new ecommerce

2. Chapter 2
=============
1. We have two entry points for our app (prod and dev) - found in web folder called app.php and app_dev.php.
app_dev.php contains the debug bar and we get a verbose error log on screen while in development.

2. php bin/console to show all available console commands
- Delete the default AppBundle created for us and remove references in both AppKernel.php and routing.yml
- php bin/console generate:bundle => MainBundle
http://localhost:8000/app_dev.php now displays Hello World.

We can define the path like /ecommerce with path variables for example /ecommerce/{name}
